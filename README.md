# Bartek Kulig – BIM Developer

I automate not only BIM models,  
but the way information flows through transport infrastructure projects.

## Who I am

BIM Lead and AEC Developer with 10+ years of experience on large-scale
transport and linear infrastructure projects, including metro systems,
high-speed rail and light rail.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- BIM & software development
- information management automation
- real-world project delivery

## Transport & Linear Infrastructure

I’ve worked on complex infrastructure projects where scale,
repetition and long asset lifecycles make manual processes impossible.

Projects include:
- High Speed Rail (UK)
- Metro systems (Dubai)
- High Frequency Rail (Canada)
- Light Rail / Rapid Transit (Canada)

## What I automate

Most AEC problems are not geometry problems – they are information problems.

I build automations for:
- BIM QA/QC and model validation (Revit, Dynamo, pyRevit)
- Information management aligned with ISO 19650
- Data extraction from models into structured datasets
- Dashboards and reporting using Power BI
- Review, approval and audit workflows using Power Automate
- Lightweight internal tools using Power Apps

## Tech stack

- Revit API (C#)
- Dynamo, Python
- pyRevit
- Power BI
- Power Automate
- Power Apps

## Why this repository exists

To show how AEC software should be built:
from real infrastructure problems,
not abstract ideas.

Automation is not about speed.
It is about trust in information.
