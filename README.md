# Bartek Kulig – AEC Developer

I don’t automate BIM models.
I automate how information survives real infrastructure projects.

## Context

I’ve spent over a decade working on large-scale transport and linear infrastructure:
metro systems, high-speed rail and long corridors where hundreds of models,
disciplines and stakeholders meet reality.

That’s where most BIM workflows break.

## What I actually do

I build automation that connects:
models → information → decisions

This includes:
- BIM QA/QC and model validation using Dynamo, Python and pyRevit
- Information management workflows aligned with ISO 19650
- Data pipelines from Revit into Power BI dashboards
- Automated reviews, approvals and audits using Power Automate
- Lightweight internal tools using Power Apps

## Why infrastructure matters

Transport projects expose broken workflows faster than any building project.
Scale, repetition and long asset lifecycles make manual processes impossible.

Automation is not optional.
It’s survival.

## Tech I use

- Revit API (C#)
- Dynamo, Python
- pyRevit
- Power BI
- Power Automate
- Power Apps

## Why this repository exists

To show how AEC software should be built:
from real project pain,
not abstract theory.

Part of the rebellion.

Automation is not about speed.
It is about trust in information.
